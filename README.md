# LinStab
Here are some routines to perform linear stability analysis
for QG models

This is mostly for personal use, at this point (i.e., being
able to pull this repo onto remote machines, rather than use scp).

Future modifications will increase efficiency of the code, add more
known methods of analysis, and hopefully add novel methods
of output from QG models...at which point I should probably change the name.
